Not because I don't think it's important but more that I think it's SO important it needs to be a fundamental part of engineering and product culture and singling it out or attaching that label only helps make it look like 'someone else's responsibility'. I guess one part of this is also looking back at the career frameworks and designing a new way of thinking about testing and quality - acknowledge the impact of AI for one, but also recognise that any engineer - core to VP - needs not only a solid understanding about their role when it comes to quality, but also a set of tools that make it simple for them to apply it."}],"\n",["$","p","p-1",{"children":"I want to turn the talking about it - testability, advocacy, and so on - into something actionable.

I don't want the next generation to feel like the guardrails are too restrictive and not enjoy the creative process. And I also want people to see Test or Quality Engineering as an important and aspirational role, not something easily replaced. So maybe that's the answer - the next frontier is the next generation. How do we keep software engineering as exciting and engaging as it was for me?"}]]}]]}]
